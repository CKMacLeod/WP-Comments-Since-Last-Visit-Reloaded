# WP-Comments-Since-Last-Visit-Reloaded
This plug-in enables readers to identify new contributions to site discussions quickly and easily. 

Upon each of a user's visits to a page, browser cookies are set and updated that allow the automatic highlighting of comments new since a previous visit, if any. Additional jQuery-enabled options allow for rapid scrolling through new comments, viewing of new comments separately, and marking all comments read. 

These features will be especially helpful where nested comments produces multiple sub-branches of discussion, making it increasingly difficult for a participant to keep up.

Because users often like to keep comments new since last visit in view, or available, while responding or browsing, the plug-in provides for an adjustable "session period" during which all new-since-last-visit comments remain highlighted, along with any comments added since the new session began. It is set by default at 15 minutes, but can be adjusted easily if desired. 

The user also has the option to re-start the session and thus "mark all comments read" by clicking a button.

## Still to do

This plug-in is under testing: Major features for now are complete, but there is still much to do while user experiences are assessed.  

*Provide a WordPress admin interface for adjusting options and conveniently adjust styles.
*Provide separate installation instructions, screenshots, and styling tips.
*Add "working," "success," and error-handling messages particularly where jQuery processes are likely to lag (on mobile interfaces and where dealing with very long comment threads).
*Refine and re-factor code where appropriate.
